<h1>Solar System</h1>
<p>Python project for displaying the Solar System at a given date. </p>
</header> 

The project animates the orbits of the Solar System's planets from 
their current position to their position at a user specified date. 

The data was obtained from E.M. Standish (1992) 
https://www.rschr.de/PRPDF/aprx_pos_planets.pdf
and adapted in order to simplify the code. Degrees were converted to
radians, certain quantites and their rates of change were combined into
others.
